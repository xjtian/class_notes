class_notes
===========

LaTex notes I've taken for my classes at school and MOOC's on the Coursera platform. I can't totally guarantee everything's 100% to-the-letter correct, but I've done my best. Also, as a heads-up, some sections are pretty janky. Off the top of my head, they include
* 273 notes on diffraction and interference (more incomplete than janky)
* 341 notes on nonlinear ODE's
* Counting and radix sort notes
* Dynamic connectivity notes

Note the 'algorithms' folder contains notes from 351, the Algorithms 1 Stanford class on Coursera, parts of the Algorithms 1 Princeton class on Coursera, and a bit of the Algorithms 2 Stanford class on Coursera.
