\section{Mathematical Models}
	Every basic operation in any programming language has a constant running time associated with it. Therefore, a very na\"{i}ve way to determine the cost/running time of an algorithm is to sum the number of basic operations.
	
	There are a number of different simplifications that can be applied to this process of analyzation.
	\begin{description}
		\item[Cost model:] Use the most expensive basic operation as the proxy for running time.
		\item[Tilde notation:] Estimate running time or memory as a function of input size $N$, and ignore lower order terms. E.g., $1/6 N^3 - 1/2 N^2 + 1/3 N \approx 1/6 N^3$.
	\end{description}
	
	In principle, accurate mathematical models can be computed for every algorithm, but for the sake of analysis, it is often simpler to approximate the running time for large values of $N$.
	
\section{Order-of-Growth Classifications}
	The small set of functions $1, \log N, N, N\log N, N^2, N^3, \text{and } 2^N$ are generally sufficient to describe order-of-growth of typical algorithms. In the end, a \textit{linear or linearithmic} algorithm is needed to keep pace with Moore's law.
	
\section{Theory of Algorithms}
	There are three types of analyses for the running time of algorithms.
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item Best case: lower bound on cost, determined by "easiest" input. This provides a goal for all inputs in the domain.
		\item Worst case: upper bound on cost, determined by "most difficult" input. This provides a guarantee for all inputs in the domain.
		\item Average case: expected cost for random input that provides a way to predict performance.
	\end{enumerate}
	
	These three types of analyses lead to two different approaches for algorithm design: to design for the worst case, and to randomize an algorithm and depend on probabilistic guarantees of the domain.

\section{Memory}
	Approximate the memory usage of an algorithm to determine if it will run on a given machine. Due to modern advancements, it is safe to assume that all pointers are 8 bytes (64-bit processors), which means that pointers can address more memory but also take up more memory.
